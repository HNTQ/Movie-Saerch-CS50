# Movie-Search-CS50

Final project for CS50 Introduction to computer Sciences.

Movie-Search is an application using flask.

## Installation

First, you need to clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HNTQ/Movie-Search-CS50.git 
```
Then change into the `Movie-Search-CS50` folder:
```bash
$ cd Movie-Search-CS50 
```

Now, we will need to create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv  # on Windows, use "python -m venv venv" instead
$ . venv/bin/activate  # on Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate" instead
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then run application
```bash
$ flask run
```

If you're using an IDE, don't forget to set an interpreter
